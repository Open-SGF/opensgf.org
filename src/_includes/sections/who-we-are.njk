                <strong class="text-darkBlue">Open SGF</strong>, a Code for America brigade, provides a forum for
                local designers; mobile, web, and application developers to
                tackle technical problems for our community. Many organizations
                lack the necessary funding to produce quality technical
                solutions for their problems. This group aims to close that
                gap by bringing people together to work on these projects
                weekly. We welcome all skill levels, and no coding experience
                is necessary.
