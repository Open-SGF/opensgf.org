            <p>
                Open SGF, a Code for America brigade, provides a forum for local designers; mobile, web, and application
                developers to tackle technical problems for our community. Many organizations lack the necessary funding
                to produce quality technical solutions for their problems. This group aims to close that gap by bringing
                people together to work on these projects weekly. We welcome all skill levels, and no coding experience
                is necessary.

                healthy relationships and meaningful life engagement, including long-term employment and financial
                stability.
